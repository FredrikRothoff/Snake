# Java Snake Game

This is a Snake game made with Java and Java Swing. To play the game, you will need to clone the repository and run the program in a Java compiler.

## Installation

To get started, you will need to download the source code for the Snake game. You can do this by cloning the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:Rothoff/Snake.git
```
Once you have the source code, you can compile and run the program in your preferred Java compiler. The main class is SnakeGame.java, which you can run to start the game.

## How to Play

The objective of the game is to eat as many food items as possible without running into your own tail. You control the snake using the arrow keys on your keyboard. Each time you eat a food item, the snake grows longer and the game gets harder.

The game ends when the snake runs into its own tail. Your final score will be displayed on the screen. You can then choose to restart the game or exit the program.
